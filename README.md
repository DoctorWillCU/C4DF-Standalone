# Civilization IV Diplomatic Features - Standalone
<strong>Current version:</strong> 11.0.0003

<strong>Current stability:</strong> Stable

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Civilization IV Diplomatic Features is a modification for Civilization V. The goal is to provide as its title suggests: integrate Civilization IV's diplomacy into Civilization V. Upon the release of Civilization V, many felt it's diplomacy was lacking in several areas, making it feel more "gamey" and less "immersive" as Civilization IV. To help remedy that, my mod adds the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharing Opinions: Players can request for other leaders to disclose their opinions of other civilizations. If agreed, leaders will share their opinions of other leaders, helping players make informed decisions about how to proceed.</li>
<li>Map Trading: Explored territory can be shared with other players upon the discovery of Military Science.</li>
<li>Technology Trading: Technology can be traded freely amongst civilizations upon the discovery of Scientific Theory. This is an optional feature and can be set to replace Research Agreements, or operate alongside them.</li>
<li>Request Help: Players that have Declarations of Friendship with other leaders may ask them for a generous donation (replacing the usual demand). This opens up functionality for players that only existed for CPUs prior to this mod.</li>
<li>Generous Offers: Leaders will occasionally gift items to human players if they have a Declaration of Friendship with them.</li>
<li>Vassalage: The largest feature of the mod, Vassalage returns from Civilization IV: Warlords. The Vassal System is overhauled from the ground up, and includes a new Vassalage Overview. Vassals are like major puppets for players; a vassal must declare war on his master's opponents, and are subjected to taxes, in exchange for protection from your master. Vassals offer a more unique way to play the game.</li>
<li>All of the above features are fully understood by the AI.</li>
</ul>
